# connectfourai

This is a Connect Four Computer you can play against. It is made with the create-react-app. Under the branch "gh-pages" is like the name says the semi-rendered finished build for
the website.

Under master you can find the source code for the app and the algorithm. logic.js contains the algorithm for the ai and connectfour.js the game renderer.

It uses a variation of the MiniMax game algorithm called "negaMax" with alpha-beta pruning. Read about it here: [Negamax on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax).
